# R-statistical-projects
I employ the Tidyverse, Dplyr, and ggplot2 packages for exploration of data exploration. I perform descriptive and inferential statistical models as well as machine learning tasks. I use the Rmarkdown and knitr tools to create automated, reproducible, and shareable reports with static or interactive outputs, in Word, PDF, HTML, PowerPoint, and other formats.
